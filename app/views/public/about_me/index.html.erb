    I am a 23 year old software engineer with a background in mathematics. I ejoy dabbling in statistics, data science and distributed systems. <br>
    I enjoy working out, and anything/everything outdoors ( seriously I will hike, run, play basketball, kayak.... pretty much whatever when I have time ), as well as reading technical books in my free time.
    My goal is to be an absolute unit of an engineer, and I hope to use this website as a way to document my journey.

    I currently work at Microsoft Azure, and outside of work I have a plethora of repositories I regularly push code to on my github. Although I enjoy programming in various languages
    I am biased towards programming in C++ because of the performance adavantage.
