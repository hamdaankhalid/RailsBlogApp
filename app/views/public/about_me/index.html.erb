    I am a <%= @age %> year old software engineer with a background in mathematics. I enjoy dabbling in statistics, data science and distributed systems.
    I enjoy working out as well as reading technical books in my free time.

    I currently work at Microsoft Azure, and outside of work I have a plethora of repositories I regularly push code to on my github. Although I enjoy programming in various languages,
